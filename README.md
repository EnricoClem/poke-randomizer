Poké Randomizer
This project consists of three main files: index.html, style.css, and app.js.
No additional installations are required to use it.
Simply open the index.html file in a web browser, and ensure you have an active internet connection for the API calls to work properly.

The APIs used come from PokéAPI, a public API that provides data on Pokémon.
